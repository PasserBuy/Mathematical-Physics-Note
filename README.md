# Mathematical-Physics-Note

This note is a personal note of Mathematical Physics written by Sadri Hassani. 
Me, the author of this note is a physics student whose either english nor physics and mathematic learnd well. 
So, there must many wrong in this note and reader can leave me a message when you find the mistake.
I use English to write this note is aimd to adapt the English environment for my Study Abroad Plan, hence I will use the GPT3.5 to polish my English whitch is the best effort what I can do.

**This note is a personal reflection on Mathematical Physics, written by Sadri Hassani. As the author of this note, I am a physics student who has not yet fully mastered the English language or the intricate realms of physics and mathematics. Consequently, there may be numerous errors within this note, and I wholeheartedly welcome any feedback from readers who encounter such mistakes.
I have chosen to write this note in English to immerse myself in an English-speaking environment, aligning with my aspirations for an upcoming Study Abroad Plan. In pursuit of this goal, I am leveraging the capabilities of GPT-3.5 to enhance my English writing skills to the best of my ability.
Your feedback and corrections are not only appreciated but encouraged. This note serves as both a personal exploration of Mathematical Physics and an opportunity for me to refine my language skills. I am deeply grateful for any assistance you can offer on this journey of growth and learning.**

The initially thouth for this note is a problems workbook in Mathematical Physics handwritting by using LiquidText in iPad. 
In the Chapter 1, I can understand the most, but when I read the Chapter 2, it is much more difficult for me to understand the Definition, Theorem, Corollary and Proposition, they are too abstract for me. 
Hence, I will look for the note of this book to help me to learn, then I find it from [RQ-Luo](https://github.com/RQ-Luo/Mathematical-Physics-Notes). 
But this note is only update the Chapter3, and the last renew is many months ago. 
That's why I want write my own note, but this work may quite slowly and might stop updating any time because the work or study or family. 

**The initial thought for this note was to create a problem workbook in Mathematical Physics, handwritten using LiquidText on my iPad. While I found Chapter 1 relatively comprehensible, I encountered significant difficulty when progressing to Chapter 2. The definitions, theorems, corollaries, and propositions in this section appeared exceedingly abstract and challenging to grasp.
To aid in my understanding, I sought notes related to this textbook and stumbled upon RQ-Luo's repository. However, these notes only the first three Chapters, and the most recent update was made several months ago. This led me to the decision to write my own notes.
I must acknowledge that this endeavor may progress slowly, and there might be periods when I'm unable to update it due to the demands of work, study, or family. Nonetheless, I'm committed to the journey of creating this resource.**

This is the first time I write so many English sentence by myself (and GPT3.5, smile), as you can see, I write these word just like a primary school student who start to write his first diary.
But it is the fortunately that the first step is the most difficult, so there will be the secend, the thrid diarys later and I can see the progress I made.

**This is the first time I have written so many English sentences by myself (with the help of GPT-3.5, of course, smile). As you can see, my writing may resemble that of a primary school student starting their very first diary.
Fortunately, they say the first step is the most challenging, so there will be second, third, and many more diaries in the future, and I will be able to witness the progress I have made**
